BackBlaze Integration
=============================

**CloudFS** provides a Rest interface to BackBlaze storage. It allows for structuring directory trees along the lines of `author`, `owner` (aka: organization) and nested contexts.
Invisible to the caller, **CloudFS** handles:
- Maintaining active authentication with **BackBlaze**
- Subsequent per-operation authN/Z
+ Network and "server-busy" recovery
+ Configurable automated retries
- Current config will retry 4 times, waiting exponentially longer between retries
- Sends email to admin if retries exhasuted
- **CloudFS** caches uploads thus users are buffered from interruptions between **Zovida** and  **B2**
- **CloudFS** optimizes uploads by using a pool of web-clients when connecting to B2. The number of clients in the pool, as well as an upper threshold of allowed clients, are configurable. Current configuration tested with 4 users simultaneously uploading 100-150 files each. If any individual file(s) in an upload were interrupted, none of the other files or requests are _blocked_. Only those individual files are retried
- Large file upload. Files over 5Gigs require special handling on **B2**.
+ Additional featiures:
- Ability to change bucket access : _public_ or _private_
- Zovida may grant an end user temporary access to files in _private_ buckets. The LMS specifies when access expires. This makes it possible to expose protected backblaze links to authenticated users' session.
